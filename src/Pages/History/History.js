            <p>The history of ReactJS can be traced back to 2010 when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, created an internal prototype of React called "FaxJS." FaxJS was built to solve a specific problem that Facebook was facing at the time, which was to update the News Feed in real-time without having to refresh the page</p>
